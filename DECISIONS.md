## Accepted baseline

### ADR-001: mobile framework

- Date: 2026-08-02
- Status: accepted
- Decision: React Native with Expo, TypeScript, Expo Router and pnpm.
- Consequences: begin in Expo Go; use cloud native builds only when a confirmed native requirement exists.

### ADR-002: backend direction

- Date: 2026-08-02
- Status: proposed
- Decision: Supabase is the preferred backend, subject to re-verification when backend work starts.
- Revisit when: requirements exceed the free tier or a feature has a materially better service.

### ADR-003: UI strategy

- Date: 2026-08-02
- Status: accepted
- Decision: branded project-owned design system using React Native/Expo primitives and official native controls. Evaluate third-party component systems per component need; do not install a full UI kit by default.
